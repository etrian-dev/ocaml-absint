- Implement tests using some testing framework
- Implement logging to debug the analysis easily
- Add transitional sem
- Extend the language with pointers, malloc and related analyses
- Revise the correctness of loop analysis
- Monadic operators for semantics with side effect that gives a value but also a possibly modified memory (e.g. malloc has a side effect of modifying memory)
